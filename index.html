  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Didn't Wanna come into this field untill this year when I heard the news about Tax Relaxation from Government on foreign Data Centres, I think this unlocks lots of job opportunities for me.<br>
<br>
  <b>Why Coding Is My Natural Career Path</b> <br>

I don’t just use technology — I interrogate it.
Whenever I see a website, app, or system, my brain quietly asks:
“How is this built… and how can it be better?”
That curiosity is the same muscle programmers use every day.<br>
<br>
<b>I Think in Systems</b><br>
I naturally break big problems into small steps — exactly how algorithms work.
Policies in governance, strategies in exams, and logic in code follow the same pattern:

Input → Process → Output → Improve → Repeat<br>
<br>
<b>Future-Proof Skill</b><br>

Administration manages society.
Programming builds the tools society runs on.
From digital governance to AI-driven decisions, technology is becoming policy’s backbone. Knowing code means understanding the engine, not just driving the vehicle.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I demonstrates a disciplined and analytical approach well-suited for civil services preparation. He shows strong curiosity across diverse domains — polity, economy, science, technology and society — and actively connects concepts instead of memorizing them in isolation. His learning style reflects conceptual clarity, especially in logical reasoning, decision-making frameworks and structured thinking, which are essential for answer writing and case studies. He consistently seeks improvement through questioning, refinement and iteration rather than passive study, indicating high self-awareness and growth mindset.<br>
    <br>He also blends traditional preparation with modern tools, using technology and problem-solving skills to understand topics efficiently — a trait valuable for administration in a digital governance era. His communication style is clear, practical and solution-oriented, showing an ability to present balanced viewpoints. Persistence, intellectual curiosity and adaptability together indicate strong potential for handling complex public issues with rational judgement and calm temperament under pressure.<br>
    <br>
Beyond academics, Ishank shows traits aligned with public service temperament — patience in understanding complex issues, willingness to reconsider opinions when presented with evidence, and a habit of structuring thoughts before expressing them. He approaches problems with practicality rather than ideology, preferring workable solutions over theoretical perfection. His preparation style indicates long-term consistency instead of short bursts of motivation, reflecting reliability — a key administrative quality. He also demonstrates comfort with interdisciplinary learning, allowing him to relate governance with technology, society and behavioural factors. Such integrative thinking suggests an ability to adapt to field realities, interact with diverse stakeholders and make informed decisions in uncertain situations while maintaining accountability and composure.
